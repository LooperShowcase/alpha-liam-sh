  <h2>Pizza</h2>
</center>
<hr/>
<p>
  Pizza[a][1] is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of
  leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other
  ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
  oven.[2] The term pizza was first recorded in the year 997 AD, in a Latin
  manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the
  border with Campania.[3] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating
  the modern pizza in Naples.[4][5][6][7] In 2009, Neapolitan pizza[8] was
  registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed
  (TSG) dish. In 2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on
  UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[9] Pizza and its variants
  are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety
  of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants),
  Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[10] In Italy,
  pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the
  use of a knife and fork.[11][12] In casual settings, however, it is
  typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is
  also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as
  kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked using a home
  oven. In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it
  was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[13] Overall, 13% of the US
  population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[14]

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<hr />

<p>
  The oldest recorded usage of the word pizza is from a Latin text from the
  town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the
  text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of
  Gaeta duodecim pizze (lit. 'twelve pizzas') every Christmas Day, and
  another twelve every Easter Sunday.[3][15] Suggested etymologies include:
  Byzantine Greek and Late Latin pitta > pizza, cf. Modern Greek pitta bread
  and the Apulia and Calabrian (then Byzantine Italy) pitta,[16] a round
  flat bread baked in the oven at high temperature sometimes with toppings.
  The word pitta can in turn be traced to either Ancient Greek πικτή
  (pikte), 'fermented pastry', which in Latin became picta, or Ancient Greek
  πίσσα (pissa, Attic: πίττα, pitta), 'pitch',[17][18] or πήτεα (pḗtea),
  'bran' (πητίτης, pētítēs, 'bran bread').[19] The Etymological Dictionary
  of the Italian Language explains it as coming from dialectal pinza,
  'clamp', as in modern Italian pinze, 'pliers, pincers, tongs, forceps'.
  Their origin is from Latin pinsere, 'to pound, stamp'.[20] The Lombardic
  word bizzo or pizzo, meaning 'mouthful' (related to the English words bit
  and bite), which was brought to Italy in the middle of the 6th century AD
  by the invading Lombards.[3][21] The shift b>p could be explained by the
  High German consonant shift, and it has been noted in this connection that
  in German the word Imbiss means 'snack'. A small pizza is sometimes called
  pizzetta.[22] A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.[23] The
  word pizza was borrowed from Italian into English in the 1930s; before it
  became well known, pizza was called "tomato pie" by English speakers. Some
  regional pizza variations still use the name tomato pie.[24]

<h2>History</h2>
<hr />
<br />
<p>
  Records of pizza-like foods can be found throughout ancient history. In
  the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during
  the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top
  of their battle shields[25][26] and the ancient Greeks supplemented their
  bread with oils, herbs, and cheese.[27][28] An early reference to a
  pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies,
  foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by
  hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are
  served a meal that includes round cakes (such as pita bread) topped with
  cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are
  the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.[29] In 2023, archeologists discovered
  a fresco in Pompeii appearing to depict a pizza-like dish among other
  foodstuffs and staples on a silver platter. Italy's culture minister said
  it "may be a distant ancestor of the modern dish".[30][31] The first
  mention of the word pizza comes from a notarial document written in Latin
  and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a payment of "twelve
  pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas
  and a couple of chickens on Easter Day".[32] Modern pizza evolved from
  similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th
  century.[33] Before that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients
  such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes were
  first added and there are many conflicting claims,[33] although it
  certainly could not have been before the 16th century and the Columbian
  Exchange. Pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries
  until about 1830, when pizzerias in Naples started to have stanze with
  tables where clients could sit and eat their pizzas on the spot.[34] A
  popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza
  Margherita,[35] was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte
  commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo ('pizza maker') Raffaele Esposito to
  create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three
  different pizzas he created, the queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed
  in the colors of the Italian flag—red (tomato), green (basil), and white
  (mozzarella). Supposedly, this type of pizza was then named after the
  queen,[36] with an official letter of recognition from the queen's "head
  of service" remaining to this day on display in Esposito's shop, now
  called the Pizzeria Brandi.[37] Later research cast doubt on this legend,
  undermining the authenticity of the letter of recognition, pointing that
  no media of the period reported about the supposed visit and that both the
  story and name Margherita were first promoted in the 1930s–1940s.[38][39]
  Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants in the late
  19th century[40] and first appeared in areas where they concentrated. The
  country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City in 1905.[41]
  Italian Americans migrating from East to West brought with them their
  dish. From there, the American version exported to the rest of the
  world.[42] The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. 'True Neapolitan
  Pizza Association') is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with
  headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan
  pizza.[43] In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered
  with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG)
  dish,[44][45] and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's
  list of intangible cultural heritage.[9]

<h1>Pizza hut</h1>
<p>
  In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks above the
  heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in
  traditional style in a wood or coal-fired brick oven. The pizza is slid
  into the oven on a long paddle, called "peel", and baked directly on hot
  bricks, a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum), or whatever
  the oven surface is. Before use, a peel is typically sprinkled with
  cornmeal to allow the pizza to easily slide on and off it.[46] When made
  at home, a pizza can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to
  reproduce some of the heating effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly on
  a metal surface results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning
  it.[47] Some home chefs use a wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed
  outdoors. As in restaurants, these are often dome-shaped, as pizza ovens
  have been for centuries,[48] in order to achieve even heat distribution.
  Another variation is grilled pizza, in which the pizza is baked directly
  on a barbecue grill. Some types, such as Sicilian pizza, deep-dish
  Chicago-style pizza and Greek pizza, are baked in a pan rather than
  directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.

<h1>Preparation</h1>
<p>
  Preparation Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size
  slices. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as
  preventing the sauce from combining with the dough, and producing a crust
  that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen
  pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts. In the US, another
  form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is
  assembled in the store, then sold unbaked to customers to bake in their
  own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic
  ingredients, to assemble at home before baking in an oven.
